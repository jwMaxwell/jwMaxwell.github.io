    <h1>Function Pointers</h1>
    <h2>Joshua Maxwell</h2>
    <p>
      C is one of my favorite weekend langauges due to its extreme simplicity
      and complexity. For proficiency in C programming, the user must first have
      a functional understanding of memory and assembly language. Without this
      understanding, some concepts, such as pointers, will only be used in a
      very limited capacity. In assembly language, every part of a program
      operates on and interacts with memory. The variables are stored in memory,
      the function definitions are stored in memory, and most importantly,
      instructions are stored in memory. Assembly language doesn't have scopes
      and functions/procedures are instead jumped to with `goto` or `jump`
      instructions. This means that functions have addresses. Functions have
      addresses and pointers are vairables which point to addresses, which means
      that we can, in theory, store functions in variables.
    </p>
    <p>Below, we see how function pointers work in a standard C program</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int add4(int x) {
    return x + 4;
}

int main() {
    int (*fn)(int) = &add4;
    printf("3 + 4 = %d", fn(3));
    return 0;
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      This concept can lead to some very interesting and useful ideas such as
      functional map and pipe functions as well as callback functions.
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int int_map (int* arr, unsigned len, int (*fn)(int)) {
    unsigned i = 0;
    while (i < len) {
        arr[i] = fn(arr[i]);
        ++i;
    }
    return 0;
}

int add2(int x) {
    return x + 2;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    unsigned arr_len = 9;
    
    int_map(arr, arr_len, &add2);
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < arr_len; ++i) {
        printf("%d, ", arr[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      For those who are unfamiliar with `map()` in functional programming, the
      function will take an array and apply a function to every element in the
      array. Tradionally, the function would return the array containing the new
      results, however, this would be much more complicated in C. With this
      knowledge in mind, the above code would output `3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
      11,`
