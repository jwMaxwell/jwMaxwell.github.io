    <h1>Array Indices</h1>
    <h2>Joshua Maxwell</h2>
    <p>
      In C/C++, arrays are often used to store data in sequential memory. The
      data in this memory is typically accessed using the syntax `array[index]`.
      In traditional syntax, the variable `array` stores the memory location of
      the first element in the array. Because the array memory is sequential, we
      can access other elements of the array by adding an index to the array
      location.
    </p>
    <p>
      A less abstract form of the array syntax would be `*(array + index)`. As
      it turns out, traditional array syntax literally translates to the
      simplified form, thus allowing us to access memory with `*(index + array)`
      or `index[array]`. In our programs, this won't have very much significance
      to the way we design our code, however it does allow us to do silly things
      like this.
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#define LENGTH 100

int main() {
  unsigned* arr = (unsigned*) malloc(LENGTH * sizeof(unsigned));
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < LENGTH;)
    arr[i] = ++i;

  // Focus on this bit
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < LENGTH; ++i) {
    unsigned a = arr[i];
    unsigned b = i[arr];
    unsigned c = *(arr + i);
    printf("a: %u, b: %u, c: %u\n", a, b, c);
  }

  return 0;
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      The above code will print the numbers from 0 to 99 in the following
      format:
    </p>
    <pre>
a: 1, b: 1, c: 1
a: 2, b: 2, c: 2
a: 3, b: 3, c: 3
a: 4, b: 4, c: 4
a: 5, b: 5, c: 5
...
</pre

    <p>
      While I have yet to find any meaningful use for this trick, it is still
      fun to explore and consider the potential uses in obfuscation (not that
      obfuscation is all that important in C).
