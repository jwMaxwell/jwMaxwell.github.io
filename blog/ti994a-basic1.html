    <h1>TI99/4a Basic p1</h1>
    <h2>Joshua Maxwell</h2>
    <p>
      I'm pretty new to Basic and I'm especially new to the TI99/4A variant. I
      refuse to let that limit my ability to create silly and over the top
      programs though. When I am learning a new language, my first program is
      always the traditional "Hello, World!". My second program is my favorite
      program: FizzBuzz.
    </p>
    <p>
      This program was an interesting challenge in TI99/4A basic Because there
      doesn't seem to be any built-in modulo or remainder operator/function.
      Instead, you have to use math.
    </p>
    <p>To start, it's always a good idea to clear the screen</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-basic">
10 CALL CLEAR
    </pre>

    <p>
      Then we will need to make a loop, which provides us the numbers from 1 to
      100
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-basic">
20 FOR I=1 TO 100
    </pre>

    <p>
      Now we can calculate whether or not I % 3, I % 5, or I % 15 have
      remainders. We will do this by dividing I by X (which returns a float) and
      then subtracting I / X type-casted to an integer (JS equivalent:
      Math.floor(y))
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-basic">
30  FB=((I/15)-INT(I/15))
40  B=((I/5)-INT(I/5))
50  F=((I/3)-INT(I/3))
    </pre>

    <p>
      Next, we can take care of the conditional statements. In this version of
      basic, conditional statements operates as follows: IF [condition] THEN
      [line#]
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-basic">
60  IF FB=0 THEN 100
70  IF B=0 THEN 120
80  IF F=0 THEN 140
    </pre>

    <p>We're almost done. Now we need to print our results</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-basic">
90  PRINT I
100 GOTO 150
110 PRINT "FIZZBUZZ"
120 GOTO 150
130 PRINT "BUZZ"
140 GOTO 150
150 PRINT "FIZZ"
    </pre>

    <p>Finally, we can continue the loop and end the program</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-basic">
160 NEXT I
170 END
    </pre>

    <p>All together, our FizzBuzz program looks like this:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-basic">
10  CALL CLEAR
20  FOR I=1 TO 100
30  FB=((I/15)-INT(I/15))
40  B=((I/5)-INT(I/5))
50  F=((I/3)-INT(I/3))
60  IF FB=0 THEN 100
70  IF B=0 THEN 120
80  IF F=0 THEN 140
90  PRINT I
100 GOTO 150
110 PRINT "FIZZBUZZ"
120 GOTO 150
130 PRINT "BUZZ"
140 GOTO 150
150 PRINT "FIZZ"
160 NEXT I
170 END
    </pre>

    <p>
      This is not the best, cleanest, or most efficient FizzBuzz, however, it is
      my FizzBuzz. That might not mean much to you, but to me it also doesn't
      all that much. It'll get better eventually. So shush.
